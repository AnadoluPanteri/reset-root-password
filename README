              Reset a forgotten root password on MeeGo Harmattan
              ==================================================

To use, copy "reset-root-password_1.0.0_all.deb" to the MyDocs partition:

    scp reset-root-password_1.0.0_all.deb user@n9:MyDocs/

Alternatively, copy the file to the device using USB Mass Storage mode.

Then, open a shell as "user" and install the package via:

    xdg-open /home/user/MyDocs/reset-root-password_1.0.0_all.deb

If you don't have access to the "user"'s shell for some reason, simply wait
a bit after disconnecting USB Mass Storage, and the .deb package should
appear in the "Search" utility when you search for it. Install it from there.

After installation, use "devel-su" to get root, and then use "passwd" to change
the password. Use "dpkg --remove reset-root-password" to remove this package
after your root password is reset.
